# PA Installation Instructions

Hey there!
I'm here to guide you through installing PA on your OnePlus 9 & 9Pro. The main requirements are a personal computer, a little patience, and a cup of coffee. 
Note: Feel free to ask for help in the Telegram group; we won't blame you, we're a family <3

## How to Unlock the Bootloader (You can skip this if you have an unlocked bootloader)

- [If you already have an unlocked bootloader, proceed directly to Step 2]

Step 1:
Identify which region your device is from by accessing the device info:

LE2XX0 = China

LE2XX1 = India

LE2XX3 = Europe

LE2XX5 = North America

LE2XX7 = T-mobile

Except for T-Mobile, you need to open the developer settings:
Settings > Device info > Version > Tap the build number three times, and congratulations, the developer settings are now open!

Now, go to additional settings > developer settings, turn on the OEM unlock option, and confirm. If your device is grayed out, it's probably either a T-Mobile device or you never connected it to the internet.

[Chapter 1.2]
- Download and extract platform-tools from [here](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools).
- Install the Google Bootloader Interface driver from [this link](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb) (right-click the .inf and select install).
- Reboot to bootloader, also known as fastboot, by pressing all buttons when the device is turned off.
- Check the device manager, and if needed, manually select the driver for the unknown device > Android > Android Bootloader Interface.
- Open the command prompt in the platform-tools folder and type: `fastboot oem unlock` (a prompt should appear on your device, press yes. WARNING! THIS WILL ERASE YOUR DATA AND THERE IS NO COMING BACK!)

# T-Mobile (This can be a bit complicated, feel free to ask for help in the group chat)
- Without risk + unlocked SIM [waiting 40 days, etc.]: Maybe they don't unlock, I don't know, you can follow this guide: [How to Unlock the T-Mobile Bootloader](https://xdaforums.com/t/how-to-unlock-the-t-mobile-bootloader.4256319/) <3
- With risk [changing region via modded MSM tool]: 
    - For OnePlus 9: [Guide](https://xdaforums.com/t/convert-t-mobile-oneplus-9-to-global-or-other-firmware.4277169/page-3#post-85143501)
    - For OnePlus 9Pro: [Guide](https://xdaforums.com/t/convert-your-t-mobile-le2127-to-eu-via-msm-no-unlock-bin-needed.4272837/)
- And follow the same steps as [Chapter 1.2] <3

Step 2:
[I assume you have already downloaded the PA image itself, the .zip one]
Now, I will ask you to update to OxygenOS 13 via OTA, or 14 would be healthier :) regardless of the intermediate version. 

Then download the firmware suitable for your device from the #firmware-flasher note in the group, and reboot to the bootloader, i.e., fastboot again. 

Extract the downloaded firmware to the desktop, open it as a folder, you will find many files, find and run the Update-firmware.bat file, and update your modem by typing yes, unless necessary (T-Mobile & China). It will do some magic and automatically reboot the bootloader. 
Then, open the command prompt in the platform-tools folder, type `fastboot update [drag and drop the PA image]`, and press enter.

-> While PA is installing on your device, you can take a sip from your coffee <3 
And when done, the phone will reboot a few times and ask you to format data, press confirm.

Voila, you should have the PA logo on your phone <3

Mert <3 Made with love.
